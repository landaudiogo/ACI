Duvidas: 

Switch:
  - How does a switch know where a MAC address is if it doesnt have the destination MAC address in its table (flooding is the answer to this, but what if there are more switches in between the two hosts trying to communicate)
 
  - When a MAC address is unknown but are in different networks, how does a sender find a destination node.
  - Even if it does know the destination MAC address but the node belongs to a different network, how does it find the destination node (shouldn't it have the gateway MAC address?).
