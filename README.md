Duvidas: 

Switch:
  - How does a switch know where a MAC address is if it doesnt have the destination MAC address in its table (flooding is the answer to this, but what if there are more switches in between the two hosts trying to communicate)
  
  - When a switch doesnt know where a destination MAC address is, it floods, but how does the switch afterwards differentiate between a collision of frames or a silent host?
